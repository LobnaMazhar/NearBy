# NearBy
App uses Foursquare API to display information about nearby places around user using user’s current location speciﬁed by Latitude and Longitude

App has two operational modes, “Realtime" and “Single Update”. 
“Realtime” allows app to always display to the user the current near by places based on his location, data should be seamlessly updated if user moved by 500m from the location of last retrieved places.


IMPORTANT To Re-Use the code :: Replace CLIENT_ID & CLIENT_SECRET in build.gradle (Module:app) and API_KEY in AndroidManifest.xml file with your own KEYS
